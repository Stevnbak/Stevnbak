### Heya ðŸ‘‹
I'm Stevn
I code a variety of things, such as web stuff, discord bots, game information gathering, games and more...

**The Cycle Frontier**

I am an information dataminer for [The Cycle Frontier](thecycle.game), this information can be found here on GitHub in the [TCF-Wiki organization](github.com/TCF-Wiki). I also work on all things [The Cycle Frontier Wiki](https://thecyclefrontier.wiki) and belonging [pages](https://apps.thecyclefrontier.wiki).

**[Website](https://stevnbak.dk)**

You can find more information about what I do on my [website](https://stevnbak.dk) I am currently working on a complete rework of this site.

**[Ordle](https://ordle.stevnbak.dk)**

Ordle is a danish version of Wordle, can be found [here](https://ordle.stevnbak.dk).

**Games**

I make small games like this one: [Maze Game](https://github.com/stevnbak/mazegame)
I try to always be working on some game, tho the process is slow on these and work is only done when I'm motivated.

**Discord Bot**

I am the creator of Stevnbot, you can invite it to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=453940369571315718&permissions=275213577280&scope=bot). I also make other private discord bots for specific features I need.
